Your mom was so nice to make waffles for you and your friend. Unfortunately, there's only one left.
Do you decide to split it or take it? if you both decide to split, then you share the waffle. However,
if you both decide to take, your mom will throw it in the trash for not wanting to share.
The kicker: if you take and your friend splits, you take the whole waffle! but careful,
if your friend takes while you want to split, he takes it all. Good luck!
